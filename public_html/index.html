        <p>A <em>Crowd</em> has many <em>Humans</em>. Each foreground circle is a Human. They are 
        simple beings with one rule: They are claustrophobic and as such will attempt to stand as 
        far away from other Humans as possible. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Double-click a Human to make it give birth</li>
            <li>Click and drag to move a Human</li>
