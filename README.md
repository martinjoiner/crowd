An experiment in crowd intelligence. Each coloured circle is a Human in a Crowd. Each Human is claustrophobic meaning they strive to position themselves as far away from neighbours as they can possibly be. With this one simple rule the Humans evenly distribute themselves throughout the floor. A single-page app written in Javascript. 

**NOTE:** This is an old project hacked out in 2012 with pretty ropey Javascript skills. I have just dug it back up and started tracking it in Git with the intention of improving the code. I have done some of the refactoring but it does not yet represent my best efforts.
