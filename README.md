An experiment in crowd intelligence. Each coloured circle is a Human in a Crowd. Each Human is claustrophobic meaning they strive to position themselves as far away from neighbours as they can possibly be. With this one simple rule the Humans evenly distribute themselves throughout the floor. A single-page app written in Javascript. 

**NOTE:** This started as an old project, hacked out in 2012 with pretty ropey JavaScript and then basically forgotten about. I dug it back up and started tracking it with Git in January 2016 with the intention of improving the code. I have done a lot of refactoring but it still does not represent my best efforts. Be gentle with your judgement.

## Code Familiarisation 

Visit the live site and use the console to inspect a global variable called _crowd_. Hopefully I have named my classes well enough that anyone digging down the object tree will gain a good understanding of the project structure.  

## Technology

vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS
